<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install Complex-Calc, follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>Clone the Repository</h3>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/anonymByte-404/complex-calc.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Build with CMake</h3>
    <p>Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands to build the project:</p>
    <pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate the <code>algebra_solver</code> executable in the <code>build/</code> directory.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Command-Line Interface</h3>
<p>Once built, you can run the application by navigating to the build/ directory and executing the following:</p>
<pre><code>./algebra_solver</code></pre>

<h3>Available Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Solve Linear Equations</b>: Input equations in the form <code>ax + b = 0</code>.</li>
  <li><b>Solve Quadratic Equations</b>: Solve equations of the form <code>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</code>.</li>
  <li><b>Evaluate Polynomials</b>: Solve polynomial equations with any degree.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program will prompt you to input the type of equation you want to solve, and guide you through the necessary steps.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example of how the tool can be used to solve a linear equation:</p>

<pre><code>Enter the type of equation to solve:
1. Linear Equation (ax + b = 0)
2. Quadratic Equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0)
...

Choose an option: 1
Enter the value of 'a': 2
Enter the value of 'b': -4
Solution: x = 2</code></pre>
